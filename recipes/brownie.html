                    <li>1/2 cup (63 grams) all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>

                <h5>Steps</h5>
                <ol class="ol-text">
                    <li>
                        Preheat the oven to 325°F. Line an 8 by 8-inch light-colored metal pan** with foil or parchment paper 
                        and spray with nonstick cooking spray.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In a microwave-safe bowl, add the butter and sugar. Microwave for about 1 minute, 
                        or until the butter is melted. Whisk in the eggs, egg yolk, and vanilla. Stir in the oil and cocoa powder.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        With a rubber spatula, stir in the flour, cornstarch, and salt until combined. Stir in the chocolate chips.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Spread the brownie batter evenly into the prepared pan. Place in the oven and bake for 30 minutes, 
                        or until the brownies are set and a cake tester inserted into the center has moist crumbs attached. 
                        Do not overcook. Let cool completely to solidify before cutting and serving.
                    </li>
                    <li>Brownies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. 
                        Brownies will be gooey when served warm, chewy when served at room temperature, and fudgy when served chilled.
                    </li>
